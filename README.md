Web Application Development Project

As part of my academic project, I developed a web application that adhered to stringent structural and non-functional requirements. The project was implemented using a multilayered architecture, following the principles of object-oriented programming and SOLID design principles.

Key Features:

 - Architecture: I implemented a multilayered architecture with four distinct layers:

 1. Data Layer: Managed data access and interaction with the relational database.
 2. Business Logic Layer: Contained the core business rules and logic, ensuring data consistency and validation.
 3. Service Layer: Facilitated communication between the business logic and presentation layers, exposing SOAP services.
 4. Presentational Layer: Handled user interactions and displayed data to the users.

 - Business Process Modeling:

Developed an algorithmic business process model to represent the flow of processes based on job descriptions.
Created a list of data stores, representing the necessary data archives using standard diagram symbols.
Conducted a detailed analysis of a business document, identifying elementary data, domains, and syntactic structures using specialized notation.

 - Software Function Design:

Mapped primitive processes from the business process model to software functions, prioritizing them and identifying prerequisites.
Developed a USE CASE diagram to illustrate software functions based on the mapping.
Specified use cases for data entry and tabular data display, detailing preconditions, postconditions, action steps, extension points, and exceptions.

 - Data Model Design:

Designed a conceptual data model to capture the high-level data relationships.
Translated the conceptual model into a physical relational data model, ensuring efficient and structured data storage.

 - Object-Oriented Design: The application was developed with a focus on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, using method overloading. Each class adhered to the Single Responsibility Principle, and dependency injection was implemented through interface classes to promote flexibility and maintainability.

 - Data Handling: I designed a relational database with at least two interconnected tables, including a user table. Stored procedures, views, and transactions were used to ensure efficient data management and integrity. The application handled multiple queries within transactions using begin transaction and commit/rollback.

 - Parameterization: To enhance security and maintainability, the connection string and decision-making parameters were stored in external files, such as XML or JSON, rather than being hardcoded.

 - Clean Code and Security: The code was written following best practices for clean coding, including comprehensive comments, meaningful identifier names, and adherence to coding conventions. 

 - Security measures included password masking during login, session management, and user authentication checks on every page.

 - Localization: The user interface and code identifiers were fully localized in Serbian to meet the non-functional requirements.

 - This project provided me with hands-on experience in developing a robust, secure, and maintainable web application, reflecting industry standards and best practices.
